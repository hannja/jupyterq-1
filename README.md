## Requirements 
- kdb+>=? v3.5 64-bit
- Anaconda Python 3.x
- [embedPy](https://github.com/KxSystems/embedPy)


## Build and Installation

After you have installed embedPy install the Python dependencies with 

pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or with conda
```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
### Download

Download the appropriate release archive from the [releases](../../releases/latest) page.


### Linux/Mac

Ensure QHOME is set and you have a working version of q in your PATH, and run

```bash
./install.sh
```

### Windows
Ensure QHOME is set and you have a working version of q in your PATH, and run

```
install.bat
```

Jupyter console, notebook and QtConsole should work, Jupyter lab has not been tested

### Mac
On mac there seem to be issues with MKL when using in embedded python mode e.g. (https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/6423)

If you have a similar issue using Anaconda Python, the command below may resolve the issue.

```conda install nomkl```


## Running after install

To run the jupyter console
```
jupyter console --kernel=qpk
```
To run the example notebook
```
jupyter notebook kdb+Notebooks.ipynb
```


## Using notebooks

See the notebook kdb+Notebooks.ipynb for full interactive examples and explanation, it should be viewable on github.
